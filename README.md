# customer_churn_SHAP_analysis_with_explainer_dashboard

This is a personal project to use explainer-dashboard package.  <br>
Note that I got the same key insight from the EDA using a python package called ydata-profiling [see my ydata=profiling project here](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/customer_churn_exploratory_data_analysis_ydata_profiling_python)<br>

**Key Insight from this EDA:  Customer "Complain" is the highest contributor to "Exited" based on SHAP values.**
[See pdf file for SHAP values](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/customer_churn_exploratory_data_analysis_ydata_profiling_python/blob/main/Profiling_Report_Customer_Churn.pdf)<br>

**Benefit:**  This package and explainer automates common exploratory analyses.  <br>
I only needed to input the model I wanted to use, which is the Random Forest Classifier Explainer. <br>
Time savings can be allocated to deeper analysis in the future.  <br>

**Data source:**  Data are from customer churn data shared by Mo Chen in YouTube. <br>

**Code:** Check out details of the code used in Jupyter Notebook [here](https://github.com/SandyGCabanes/customer_churn_exploratory_data_analysis_ydata_profiling_python/blob/main/eda_customer_churn_ydata_profiling.ipynb)
