# customer_churn_SHAP_analysis_with_explainer_dashboard

Personal project to use explainer-dashboard package.  I got the same key insight from the EDA using ydata-profiling. 
<li>Key Insight from this EDA:  Customer "Complain" is the highest contributor to "Exited" based on SHAP values. </li> See pdf file for SHAP values

Benefit:  This frees up time for the company and for analysts, and time savings can be allocated to deeper analysis in the future.  <br>
Data source:  Data are from customer churn data shared by Data With Mo in youtube. 

Check out the print-out pdf file here in this repository.
